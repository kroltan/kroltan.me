    <p>I couldn't find these lyrics anywhere on the internet, so here we go, organized by album.</p>
    <p>
        For songs I thought needed it, I've colored in where each speaker is speaking,
        to hopefully convey some of the nuance in text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not scrape this or put it on lyric aggregators.
        I can't enforce that of course, the lyrics ain't mine in the first place, but I can ask.

            <p>After the covertly sexual Coal-hearted Woman, I transcribed "Paul" here, framing this as a breakup song.</p>

        <p data-m>Down the coast, around the cave.</p>
        <p data-m>We'll sail to where the right wells wind.</p>
        <p data-m>Two years a berth before the mast, we'll make a man of you at last.</p>
        <p data-m>From a wheezing little boy, who cries 'cause his mother is gone.</p>
        <p data-m>You will hear the siren's song.</p>
        <p data-m>We sail with a following tide.</p>
        <p data-m>Hard tack and salt beef, watery rum and loose teeth.</p>
        <p data-m>Your skin will blister, crack and peel.</p>
        <p data-m>You will know what the devil feels in hell down below.</p>
        <p data-m>But near enough to Jack.</p>
        <p data-m>So say your prayers and heave away.</p>
        <p data-m>There's nonny when we get back.</p>
        <p data-m>Flail off loud and furl the sails, and brace the yarn against the coming gale.</p>
        <p data-m>'Cause the wind is blowing and the ship will list.</p>
        <p data-m>Waves will crash and wash across this deck, carry away everything that ain't lashed down.</p>
        <p data-m>And better men than you have drowned in a bluer sea than this.</p>
        <p data-m>There she blows off the the larboard bow, into the boats and two are down.</p>
        <p data-m>Get close enough to see its eye, and throw a hook deep in its hide.</p>
        <p data-m>It's good as gold and we bring it all back home.</p>
        <p data-m>And your reward is a sailor's share</p>
        <p data-m>Of a hull full of oil and bone,</p>

        <aside>
            <p>
                Okay, this one is some pretty thinly veiled funny business,
                but there's an interesting angle I have only noticed as I was transcribing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The woman actually kind of sings ahead of the man in the backing track, with a much more monotonous voice,
                it kind of sounds like a story she heard "oh so many times".
            </p>
            <p>
                She also notedly does not sing the "Won't you" part of the refrain,
                which as a stretch could be how she interprets that he is not really asking, just saying what he wants to do?
                Mega oof if it's meant like that, but maybe I may have misheard it.
            </p>

        <p data-m>Your fields have lain fallow for far too many years.</p>
        <p data-w1>They need a hand that's strong enough to till them.</p>

        <p data-w1>I would turn the earth.</p>
        <p data-m data-w1>We could plant a tree inside the garden.</p>

        <p data-m>I'd like to sink my shaft in your South Virginia hills.</p>
        <p data-m>I dream of all the treasures I would find.</p>
        <p data-w1>My heart and my soul are copper ore and coal. Precious rubies, chased with things of gold.</p>
        <p data-m>Overhead the milky way shines across your grassy fields.</p>

        <p data-w1>My friend gave me some advice</p>
        <p data-w1>When she sent me some cigarettes in the mail</p>
        <p data-w1>The post office opened them</p>
        <p data-w1>But fortunately the words remain</p>
        <p data-w1>She said:</p>
        <p data-w1>Don't let them see your heart</p>
        <p data-w1>Don't manifest expression that way</p>
        <p data-w1>If it's got to be on your sleeve, your heart</p>
        <p data-w1>Should be blindfolded and costumed in ???</p>

        <p data-w1>The sun is a bright bright thing</p>
        <p data-w1>And orbits the sky to light up the day</p>
        <p data-w1>It grows and it makes things die</p>
