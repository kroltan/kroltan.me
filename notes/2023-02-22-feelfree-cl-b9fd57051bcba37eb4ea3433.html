    Hello! I'm Leo.
</p>
<p>
    I've been developing games in Unity since 2018, and previously worked in web development
    since 2013. I've worked in a variety of environments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Small multidisciplinary team responsible for the entire project lifecycle, from concept to production and release;</li>
    <li>Startups in a growth phase, with large-ish teams separated by discipline and a bit more ceremony;</li>
    <li>Embedded on client teams as part of an agency type workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've been doing game development professionally for over 4 years, and as a hobby for 10. In this time I have grown
    to know basically every part of the engine, be it graphics, physics, editor tooling, and even wrote some C# compiler
    extensions, though my main focus and interest is in gameplay and tooling.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked developing gameplay features to an estabilished product (<a href="https://playpkxd.com/">PK XD</a>, a
    giant mobile social game for kids), as well as new products (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afterverse.pkxdinfinity">PKXD Infinity</a>, an infinite runner game,
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.sistemafaeg.agrinho">Programa Agrinho</a>, a quiz/task based game with real-world activities, as well as proprietary projects on my previous job).
</p>
<p>
    Now, as for my interest in the position, I was of course intrigued by the beautiful art of your game, but mainly the
    fact you're looking for someone with broad engine knowledge as well as specifically in the gameplay and tooling areas.
</p>
<p>
    I hope I have described my experience above, so let me tell you a bit of what I'm looking for. The common theme in
    my work is: I like to make people's experiences better. Be it gameplay programming, where I'm making the player's
    experience with the game better, tool programming, where I'm empowering the tool's users (be them other programmers,
    designers, or artists), and software architecture, where I'm making other programmers' work easier.
</p>
<p>
    In that way, I'm someone who appreciates quality with pragmatism, I always strive to do my best and incentivize my
    peers to do our best within the possible scope, and I also understand that consistent quality is often better than
    have one really polished experience amidst poor ones. 
</p>
<p>
    I really value working in a place that understands their pace, and is not beholden to immediate pressure from
    investors. It wounds me to introduce a mechanic that takes fun out of the game to promote monetization, as I believe
    games ought to be genuinely engaging ("fun" in the abstract sense) so that they are worth their value,
    not the other way around.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I understand you're looking for people able to work synchronously, and while I live in a place a bit
    farther from your expected timezone (GMT-3), it would not be too cumbersome for me to work syncrhonized to CET
    as needed. (Or even relocate, though I do not presume you would be interest in that)
</p>
<p>
    Kindly,
</p>
