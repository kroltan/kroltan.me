    Hello! I'm Leo.
</p>
<p>
    I've been developing games in Unity since 2018, and previously worked in web development since 2013, with gamedev as
    a hobby. In this time I have grown to know basically every part of the engine, be it graphics, physics, editor
    tooling, and even wrote some C# compiler extensions!
</p>
<p>
    I've worked developing gameplay features to an established product (<a href="https://playpkxd.com/">PK XD</a>, a
    giant mobile social game for kids), as well as new products (<a
        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afterverse.pkxdinfinity">PKXD Infinity</a>, an infinite
    runner game,
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.sistemafaeg.agrinho">Programa Agrinho</a>, a quiz/task
    based game with real-world activities, as well as proprietary projects on my previous job).
</p>
<p>
    Now, as for my interest in the position, I am of course a big fan of VR (I got a HTC Vive as soon as I could), and
    believe I am a great fit to your requirements:
</p>
<p>
    I've made games (to various degrees of professionalism) with Unity since version 3.6, and have never stopped
    learning. I'm also familiar with the graphics workflow and shader programming (In fact, I recently released
    <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/add-ons/keen-vectors-beta-254369">Keen Vectors</a>, a vector-shape
    importer and rendering tool for Unity) and have a mind for optimization and maintainability.
</p>
<p>
    While I haven't played Synth Riders yet, I can see it is a huge upgrade in quality and polish when compared to your
    competitors, and that is something I strive for whenever possible. 
</p>
<p>
    Kindly,
</p>
<p>
