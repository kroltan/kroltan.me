                a 3D multiplayer social game for kids (think Club Penguin styled after The Jetsons) with >100 million

            <ul>
                <li>Marking backpack items as favorites for easier access to preferred items;</li>
                <li>Health, score and respawn logic for shooter-based UGC games, from networking, to gameplay, and UI;

            </ul>
            <p>
                I worked mainly with C# on the Unity game client, but would sometimes dip into the server-side Protobuf
                and Kotlin code when needed. Also worked on the software architecture, fundamental features and tooling
                for unannounced projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built an ECS-inspired architecture to standardize the local access as well as network synchronization of
                interactive game objects for an unnanounced project, allowing for faster development of networked
                gameplay features. Using said architecture, implemented an object picking menu for touchscreen interactions
                between player and world in third-person.
